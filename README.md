This repository is the source code for the architecture of 
the machine learning models described in our paper.
Of note, given the proprietary nature of this work though, 
we were not able to provide the code for the data processing stage and feature engineering.


### Requirements
    python>=3.6
    tensorflow
    numpy
    keras
    sklearn
    xgboost
  

The code implements the architecture described in:

You can find all our used models in model_creation.py

All our deep sequential models including CNN and LSTM architectures with attention can be found under the deep folder.
